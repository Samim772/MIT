## Overview

The Password Manager Tool is a secure and user-friendly application designed to help users generate, store, and retrieve complex passwords. It aims to enhance users' overall security posture online by providing them with a convenient and secure way to manage their passwords.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Generate strong, random passwords based on specified criteria (length, complexity, etc.).
- **Password Storage**: Securely store passwords using strong encryption algorithms to protect them from unauthorized access.
- **Password Retrieval**: Retrieve stored passwords securely using a master password for decryption.
- **Password Strength Checker**: Check the strength of passwords to ensure they meet security standards.
- **Backup and Sync**: Backup encrypted password data and sync it across multiple devices for easy access.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Tkinter (for the GUI), Cryptography (for encryption), SQLite (for database storage)
- **Tools**: Git (for version control), GitHub (for project hosting and collaboration)
