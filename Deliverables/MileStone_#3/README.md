# Milestone 3: Security and Encryption Implementation

## Objective
Implement security features in the Password Manager Tool, including encryption for password storage and user authentication mechanisms.

## Tasks
1. **Encryption for Password Storage**: Implement encryption algorithms to securely store passwords, ensuring they are protected from unauthorized access.
2. **User Authentication**: Develop a user authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users accessing the application.
3. **Additional Security Measures**: Implement additional security measures as needed, such as session management and access control.

## Timeline
- Start Date: April 22, 2024
- End Date: May 6, 2024

## Deliverables
1. **Encrypted Password Storage**: Completed implementation of encryption for password storage.
2. **User Authentication Mechanism**: Implemented user authentication mechanism to verify user identity.
3. **Additional Security Features**: Implemented additional security measures, such as session management and access control.

## Testing
- Develop a testing plan to ensure the security features are implemented correctly.
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and address any security vulnerabilities.

## Dependencies
- Completion of Milestone 2: Core Functionality Implementation.
- Availability of necessary resources (time, budget, personnel) for implementation.

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk: Implementation of encryption and authentication mechanisms may introduce security vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.
  - Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing and seek assistance from security experts to ensure implementation is secure.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with Milestone 4: Additional Features and Testing, building upon the security features implemented in this milestone.
