# Milestone 2: Core Functionality Implementation

## Objective
Implement the core functionality of the Password Manager Tool, including basic password generation, storage, and retrieval features.

## Tasks
1. **Password Generation**: Develop a feature that allows users to generate strong, random passwords based on specified criteria (length, complexity, etc.).
2. **Password Storage**: Implement a secure storage mechanism for passwords, ensuring they are encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
3. **Password Retrieval**: Create a feature that allows users to retrieve their stored passwords securely using a master password for decryption.

## Timeline
- Start Date: April 8, 2024
- End Date: April 22, 2024

## Deliverables
1. **Password Generation Feature**: Completed implementation of the password generation feature.
2. **Password Storage Mechanism**: Secure storage mechanism for passwords, with encryption and protection measures in place.
3. **Password Retrieval Feature**: Completed implementation of the password retrieval feature.

## Testing
- Develop a testing plan to ensure the functionality of the implemented features.
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and address any bugs or issues.

## Dependencies
- Completion of Milestone 1: Project Planning and Design.
- Availability of necessary resources (time, budget, personnel) for implementation.

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk: Implementation of encryption may be complex and time-consuming.
  - Mitigation: Allocate sufficient time and resources for encryption implementation, and seek assistance from experts if needed.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with Milestone 3: Security and Encryption Implementation, building upon the core functionality implemented in this milestone.
