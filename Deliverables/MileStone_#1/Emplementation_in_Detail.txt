         # Project Plan: Password Manager Tool
         
         ## Project Scope
         The project aims to develop a secure and user-friendly password manager tool. The tool will allow users to generate, store, and retrieve complex passwords securely. Key features include password generation, storage, retrieval, and encryption.
         
         ## Objectives
         1. Develop a user-friendly interface for the password manager tool.
         2. Implement password generation, storage, and retrieval features.
         3. Ensure passwords are encrypted and stored securely.
         4. Conduct thorough testing to ensure functionality and security.
         5. Prepare documentation, including a user manual and final testing report.

         ## Risks and Mitigation
         - Risk: Lack of experience with encryption algorithms may lead to implementation issues.
           - Mitigation: Research and consult with experts to ensure proper implementation.
         
         - Risk: Time constraints may impact the completion of all planned features.
           - Mitigation: Prioritize key features and adjust timeline if necessary.
         
         ## Communication Plan
         - Weekly progress meetings to discuss status and address any issues.
         - Use of project management tools (e.g., Trello, Jira) to track tasks and deadlines.

2. Design Document:
   - Design the user interface for your password manager tool, including the layout of the main window and any additional windows or dialogs.
   - Specify the features and functionality of your application, including how users will generate, store, and retrieve passwords.
   - Consider the security aspects of your application, including how passwords will be encrypted and stored securely.

3. Implementation:
   - Once you have completed your project plan and design document, you can begin implementing the core functionality of your password manager tool.
   - Start with basic features such as password generation and storage, and gradually add more advanced features such as encryption and user authentication.

4. Testing and Iteration:
   - As you implement each feature, be sure to test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
   - Iterate on your design and implementation based on user feedback and testing results, making improvements and enhancements as needed.

5. Documentation:
   - Throughout the project, keep detailed documentation of your progress, including any changes you make to your design or implementation.
   - Prepare a user manual and final testing report as part of Milestone 5, summarizing your project and how to use your password manager tool.

6. Deployment:
   - Once your application is complete and thoroughly tested, you can prepare it for deployment.
   - Consider how you will distribute your application, whether through a downloadable file or an online platform.
