1. Project Plan: 
   - Define the scope of your project, including the key features you want to include in your password manager tool.
   - Set clear objectives and goals for the project, including what you hope to achieve by the end of each milestone.
   - Identify the resources you will need for the project, including time, budget, and personnel.
   - Create a timeline and milestones for the project, outlining when each task will be completed.

2. Design Document:
   - Design the user interface for your password manager tool, including the layout of the main window and any additional windows or dialogs.
   - Specify the features and functionality of your application, including how users will generate, store, and retrieve passwords.
